## Problem Statement

Global food wastage represents a pressing challenge with profound environmental, economic, and social consequences. Annually, a significant portion of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted across the supply chain. This inefficiency leads to:

* **Environmental Degradation**: Contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, wastes resources, and promotes deforestation.
* **Economic Losses**: Wasted costs in purchasing, processing, and disposal.
* **Social Inequity**: Wastage coexists with global food insecurity.

Organizations without accurate predictive models remain prone to over-preparation, spoilage, and poor inventory management.

---

## Proposed Solution

A data-centric solution using predictive modeling and optimization:

* **Advanced Forecasting Models**: Utilize historical data to forecast food waste based on variables like food type, guest count, event type, seasonality, etc.
* **Optimization Strategies**: Use insights to adjust production, optimize storage, and refine logistics.
* **Enhanced Resource Allocation**: Improve efficiency in resource usage to reduce costs and improve sustainability.

---

## Impact and Significance

* **Environmental Sustainability**: Reduces emissions, conserves resources.
* **Economic Efficiency**: Reduces waste-related costs.
* **Operational Excellence**: Improves planning, efficiency, and profitability.
* **Ethical Responsibility**: Supports responsible consumption and resource equity.
